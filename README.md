Development
-------------
The game is developed using front-end programming languages including HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to render the game on a browser. Game styles are created using CSS. All functionality is created using JavaScript.

> **Development Features:**

> - To make the grid clickable, a unique class was assigned to each grid. The box containing the game interface was further divided into a 3x3 grid to create 9 boxes assigned with a unique class.
> - Necessary styling was created to highlight not yet played boxes as well as played boxes.
> - Created a  display message informing the winner.
> - It has a reset button to <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **reset the game** within the current tournament and a button to <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **reset scores** after the tournament.
> - The code tracks any clicks that happen on the cells. It checks if a valid move has been made.
> - It makes sure that nothing happens if an already played cell has been clicked. It updates the game state and validates the game.
> - After validation, if we have a winner, it stops the game. The code reflects the updates made on the UI and resets based on user action.
